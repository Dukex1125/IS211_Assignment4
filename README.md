In the search_compare file, I am unable to return a time on binary_search_recursive function.  Otherwise the function will 
  run and output a boolean value whether the value exists in the sorted list.

In the sort_compare file, I'm not sure what I needed to do for a python_sort function.  Also a docstring is missing on the
  gap_insertion_sort function because I'm not sure what the parameters really do.
